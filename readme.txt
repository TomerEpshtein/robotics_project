The archive file consists of:
1. This readme.txt file.
2. Robotics.pdf file.
3. code folder.

In the code folder there exists my last version with the whole code I've been written in the project.

Instructions for checking the project:
1. Follow the file Robotics.pdf.

Everything (but really everything) is written in Robotics.pdf -
the appropriate links for the code, explanations, results of experiments, figures and more are there.

For example, instructions for running my code and the structure of the code I created
in the DyscoPygal package - are located at docs.md file in the code folder (it's written in the Robotics.pdf)
